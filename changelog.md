## 🐞 Known Issues
- Browser's anti-aliasing meses up monochrome filers.
- When scaling a window, if fractions occur, the window has random dimensions.

  👉 Do not set, for example, 1283px at 50% scaling.
- The algorithm that calculates the available viewport IDs sometimes gives wrong IDs.

  👉 Ignore it, or use free mode. 
- On the first application startup, the **Render** function may not work.

  👉 Simply run app again.

## ⚠️ Potential Limitations

-   The application is designed for **plain CSS** only.  
    Framework-based projects (React, Angular, Vue, etc.) or more advanced HTML structures may cause unexpected behavior.
-   Currently, there is no support for **Safari- or Firefox-exclusive media queries**.  
    (Planned in future releases.)
- Grid mode does not simulate terminals correctly. However, the media query itself will be activated.
- This emulator only modifies CSS—there is currently no JS hooks.
- **Potential** differences between simulated high-contrast and real behavior.

## [1.1.8] - 13.05.2026

- A critical bug that prevented the program from processing files on Windows has been fixed.

Get ready—a major update is coming!

---

## [1.1.7] - 01.01.2026

- Sometimes, complex tags were rendered incorrectly. A fix has been implemented to address this issue.

---

## [1.1.6] - 24.09.2025

- Files have been optimized. Now the project takes up 440kB less disk space!
- Fixed bugs with selectors starting with ::. They caused QSA function errors, and the CSS file conversion itself was broken.
- Unnecessary console.log() statements have been removed, and the remaining ones have been translated into English.
- Iframes used to have a transparent background, so the background of the page was identical to the background of the application. Now, iframe in screen_viewport.html have a white background, so if the user has not defined a background color in CSS, the page will have a default white background.

---

## [1.1.5] - 20.09.2025

- JS used to load faster than the emulator's iframe, which caused errors with innerHeight and innerWidth. Now the page is loaded after the dimensions of window are set.

---

## [1.1.4] - 15.09.2025

- Monochrome filters has been improved. Anti-aliasing still messes up filters, but it works a little better.

---

## [1.1.3] - 09.09.2025

- Fixed bugs related to :root.
- Better comments in the code.

---

## [1.1.2] - 30.08.2025

- The “Rotate” function, which caused errors with media queries, has been removed. You must change the dimensions yourself before running the test.
- Fixed bugs related to pseudoclasses.

---

## [1.1.1] - 21.08.2025

- media-query.js has been improved to avoid conflicts with the user's page. The code has also been shortened.
- Fixed bugs related to some env().

---

## [1.1.0] - 20.08.2025

- Forced colors has been improved - CSS code is injected into the page to simulate the selected high contrast mode (based on the default filters in Windows 11 - Aquatic, Desert, Dusk and Night sky).
- Missing support for `spanning` media query has been added.

---

## [1.0.1] - 19.08.2025

- Device visualization has been improved.
- Browser selection has been locked on Chromium.

---

## [1.0.0] - 18.08.2025

- Renders CSS files and `<style>` tags.
- Supported media queries : `aspect-ratio`, `color`, `color-gamut`, `color-index`, `device-aspect-ratio`, `device-height`, `device-posture`, `device-width`, `display-mode`, `dynamic-range`, `forced-colors`, `grid`, `height`, `hover`, `inverted-colors`, `monochrome`, `orientation`, `overflow-block`, `overflow-inline`, `pointer`, `prefers-color-scheme`, `prefers-contrast`, `prefers-reduced-motion`, `prefers-reduced-transparency`, `resolution`, `scripting`, `update`, `width`, `-webkit-transform-3d`.
  
  The `any`, `min`, and `max` variants are also included.
- Monochrome mode activates a color filter that helps with UI design. You can choose from white, green, amber, and blue colors. In addition, you can choose 1, 2, or 4 bits, and thanks to the “filter only” mode, you can also simulate devices that do not send the appropriate information to the browser despite being monochrome, such as Kindle.
- The filter also works with inverted colors (can be combined with monochrome).
